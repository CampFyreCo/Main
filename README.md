# Camp Fyre
A place to hang out and chat with your friends.

I started this project, after seeing Discord, and the massive amount of complaints they get, with no resolution, as well as with my own grievances.

This is still very much a work in progress, and nowhere near done.

If you would like to support development, you can donate [here](https://ko-fi.com/campfyre), and if you would like to participate in beta builds, or generally ask about the app, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XhwwW9zkPx).

<sub>yes, I see the irony in mentioning Discord having problems and using a Discord server as a form of communication.</sub>
